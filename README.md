 Beyond Sunlight: We are proud to have been able to work on this challenge provided by NASA

This is a currently hands off simulation except for if you click on the vents/organisms that bring up information on how they are currently interacting with the ecosystem. 
The simulation has some random elements; the chemosynthetic organisms rely on the vents in order to survive and if they spawn at a vent that does not produce the chemical they need to live they will die although that is not currently shown visibly we plan in the future to implement a way to visualize why things die. 
As it is now there are no ways for the organisms to reproduce though we do plan to add this in later; while there is no variety in species to as of yet. 
We also plan to make the simulation more interactive by allowing you to change different variables such as; reproduction rate, amount of each species, rates of hunger, etc. 
This would be in order to show how delicate ecosystems truly are.
